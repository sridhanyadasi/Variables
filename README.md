# Variables in C

This repository contains simple C programs that explain
the concept of variables and different ways of assigning values.

The examples demonstrate variable declaration,
initialization, assignment, and common mistakes.

## What is a Variable?
A variable is a named memory location used to store data.
The value stored in a variable can be changed during program execution.

## Why We Use Variables?
- To store data temporarily
- To reuse values in a program
- To perform calculations
- To make programs dynamic and flexible

## Types of Variable Usage Covered
- Declaration of variables
- Initialization at declaration time
- Assignment after declaration
- Multiple variable declaration
- Chained assignment (a = b = c)
- Printing values using printf

## Importance of Variables
- Variables help manage memory efficiently
- They improve program readability
- They make programs reusable and maintainable

## Key Observations
- Variables must be declared before use
- A data type must be specified for every variable
- Multiple variables of the same type can be declared in one line
- Values can be assigned in different valid ways

## Purpose of This Repository
- To understand variables clearly
- To practice different assignment styles
- To observe output and errors
- To build strong C programming basics
